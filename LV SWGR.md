
ULTRA SPR — LV & MV Switchgear / Switchboards and IEC Standards (NO LINKS)

1) Switchgear standards are a safety-and-performance contract between system designer, panel builder, and end user.
2) Global compliance splits into installation standards (IEC/NEC families) and product/assembly standards (IEC/UL/ANSI/NEMA families).
3) LV assemblies pivot from “legacy interpretation” to “explicit verification” when moving from IEC 60439 to IEC 61439.
4) IEC 61439 replaces IEC 60439 for LV switchgear and controlgear assemblies and tightens both responsibilities and proof obligations.
5) The old TTA/PTTA framework is removed and replaced by the “verified ASSEMBLY” concept.

6) IEC 61439 makes verification the manufacturer’s responsibility and defines approved routes to compliance.
7) Design verification has three allowed methods: Test, Calculation, and Design Rules derived from tested combinations.
8) Test is treated as the primary option; calculation/design-rule usage is controlled and includes safety margins.
9) Routine verification is mandatory for each delivered assembly and is distinct from design verification.

10) IEC 61439 design verification is split into “construction” and “performance” domains.
11) Construction domain includes materials/parts strength and environmental durability (corrosion, heat, UV, impact, lifting, marking).
12) Construction domain also includes enclosure protection (IP), and insulation geometry control (clearance/creepage).
13) Construction domain includes protective circuit integrity: continuity and protective circuit short-circuit strength.
14) Construction domain includes correct incorporation of devices and correct internal/external wiring and terminals.

15) Performance domain includes dielectric properties (power-frequency and impulse withstand).
16) Performance domain includes temperature rise limits and verification to prevent overheating and loss of service continuity.
17) Performance domain includes short-circuit withstand of busbars and circuits (thermal + electrodynamic robustness).
18) Performance domain includes EMC suitability when electronics are present.
19) Performance domain includes mechanical operation endurance (increased operating cycles requirement).

20) Numeric anchors used in the material: clearance up to 14 mm and creepage up to 25 mm for a referenced case.
21) Protective circuit effective continuity target is R < 0.1 Ω and must remain unimpaired after withstand tests.
22) Protective circuit short-circuit strength is constrained to 60% of the main circuit Icw reference value in the described verification approach.
23) Temperature rise limits are treated as fire-prevention controls, not merely reliability targets.
24) Example temperature rise limits given: terminals 70 K, busbar 90 K (class B context), enclosure 55 K.

25) Short-circuit withstand verification is intended to prevent rupture, projection, arc propagation, and extended outage.
26) Example withstand figures referenced include Icw 50 kA–3 s or 85 kA–1 s and corresponding peak withstand context.
27) Tests require conductors and insulating parts to retain dielectric and mechanical properties after fault application.

28) EMC requirements are conditional: assemblies without electronics have no immunity/emission requirements; with electronics, compliance and correct installation are required.
29) Routine verification for EMC is typically none unless prerequisites are not met; design verification applies when needed.

30) Internal separation (segregation) is standardized via IEC 61439-2 forms (Form 1 to Form 4b).
31) Segregation is implemented via partitions, barriers, shutters, insulation, or device arrangement to improve safety and maintainability.
32) Forms are associated with IP XXB / IP 2X style protection logic for contact safety in compartments.
33) Segregation form is a “fault containment and maintenance continuity lever,” not a cosmetic feature.

34) Maintainability classes for removable parts include Fixed (F), Disconnectable (D), and Withdrawable (W).
35) Connection coding uses three letters for incoming, outgoing, and auxiliary circuits; example notation “WWW” expresses withdrawable behavior across all.

36) Enclosure protection is expressed by IP (dust/water ingress) and IK (mechanical impact) indices as design/test constraints.
37) Clearances/creepage control prevents arc ignition, insulation degradation, and connection damage under nominal and overvoltage conditions.
