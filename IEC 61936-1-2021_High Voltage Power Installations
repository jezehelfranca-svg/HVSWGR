SPR — IEC 61936‑1:2021 High‑Voltage Power Installations


High‑voltage power installations >1 kV AC / >1.5 kV DC require unified global safety, reliability, and functional design rules.


HV installations include substations, power stations, industrial plants, offshore platforms, and transition structures.


Excludes transmission lines, railway traction, mining, ships, offshore drilling, test sites, and medical equipment.


Core objective: protect human life, livestock, property; ensure safe operation under normal and abnormal conditions; prevent electrical, mechanical, thermal, environmental hazards.


Fundamental design inputs: site access, environment, topography, seismicity, soil resistivity, pollution level, EM fields, noise, fauna, humidity, temperature.


Electrical design:

Must withstand normal currents, short‑circuit currents, switching stresses.
Neutral earthing method dictates fault current, protection philosophy, insulation level.
Overvoltage protection via surge arresters, insulation coordination per IEC 60071.
Harmonics, EMC, corona, radio interference must be controlled.



Mechanical design: structures must survive dead load, tension, wind, ice, erection loads, switching forces, short‑circuit forces, seismic accelerations, loss of conductor tension.


Environmental design: indoor/outdoor temperature classes, humidity up to 95–98%, UV, pollution per IEC 60815, condensation, precipitation, dust, corrosive gases, explosive atmospheres per IEC 60079.


Insulation: minimum clearances depend on Um, LIWV/SIWV; altitude corrections; dynamic clearances under wind/short‑circuit/insulator failure; dielectric tests required when clearances reduced.


Definitions anchor latent structure:

Electrical equipment, Um, Ua, rated values, active parts, feeder, ferro‑resonance, TOV, transient overvoltage.
Earthing system, earth electrode, RE, ZE, EPR, touch/step voltage, transferred potential.
Protective barrier, protective obstacle, enclosure, clearance N (danger zone).



Safety measures:

Prevent direct contact via barriers, obstacles, placing out of reach, enclosures (IP2X/IP2XC).
Prevent indirect contact by earthing system designed for permissible touch voltages.
Arc‑fault mitigation: interlocks, current‑limiting devices, pressure‑relief, remote operation, arc‑tested equipment (IEC 62271‑200/203).
Fire protection: separation distances, EI/REI fire walls, liquid containment, extinguishing systems, low‑flammability materials.



Equipment requirements:

Switchgear: clear indication of positions, robust interlocks, withstand ionized gas, fault duties.
Transformers: fire risk evaluation, cooling, noise, oil containment, ferro‑resonance mitigation, safe access for sampling.
GIS: gas compartment marking, SF6 handling, vibration isolation, accurate earthing/bonding.
Cables: temperature limits, short‑circuit forces, mechanical protection, proximity analysis, induced voltage mitigation.
Rotating machines: terminal box fault containment, temperature rise protection, enclosure IP ratings.



Buildings: structural strength, fire resistance (60–120 min), ventilation/airflow, emergency exits, aisles (≥800 mm), escape routes (20–40 m max), doors opening outward.


Outdoor installations: minimum boundary distances, fence heights ≥1800 mm, conductor heights H = N + 2250 mm (≥2500 mm), building clearance W = N+1000/2000 mm.


Earthing system:

Safety criterion derived from IEC 60479 body current limits.
Touch voltage limits per Annex B/C.
Global earthing system preferred in industrial/urban areas.
Earthing must withstand thermal/mechanical stresses for full fault duration.
Bonding of GIS, transformer tanks, cable sheaths essential.



Protection systems:

Overcurrent, short‑circuit, earth‑fault, thermal, over/under‑voltage, under‑frequency.
Coordination studies required; backup protection mandatory.
Integrated protection/control acceptable only with functional independence.



Automation & auxiliary systems:

Control/monitoring, load shedding, emergency shutdown, re‑acceleration.
UPS for essential AC loads; DC batteries sized for blackout scenarios.
SF6 gas plants, hydrogen cooling systems, compressed air systems require safe handling, monitoring, venting.



EMC design:

Shielded cables, equipotential bonding, filtered supplies, segregation of circuits, twisted pairs, metallic ducts, optical fibers for sensitive signals.



Testing & commissioning:

Visual checks, functional tests, dielectric tests (if required), trial operation.
Documentation, manuals, safe working procedures must follow IEC/IEEE 82079‑1.
